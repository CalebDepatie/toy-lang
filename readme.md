A very simple test language, not made with any real intent other than because it seemed interesting to try.

It's so simple there doesnt really need to be a seperate lexer and parser, but if I feel like adding on later it's nice to have to have it properly made.

Overall usage is done through a REPL and the language is similar to assembly,

```
  ACTION VARIABLE|VALUE
  ...
```
